# Vibe-Code-Assignment

A combined repository demonstrating **modern AI-assisted development** and **frontend payment simulation** — built using both **HTML/CSS/JavaScript (UPI Payment Demo)** and **React + TypeScript (Vibecoding Showcase Hub)**.

---

## 1️⃣  UPI Payment Demo — Frontend Web App

### Overview
This project is a **UPI Payment Demo Web App** built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
It allows users to simulate a UPI payment request by entering payment details such as **Payee UPI ID**, **Payee Name**, and **Transaction Note**. The app then generates a **UPI payment URI** that can be used to open and process payments in any UPI-compatible mobile application.

This project demonstrates basic web development, form handling, and UPI integration concepts for learning and experimentation purposes.

│
├── index.html # Main UI for payment demo
├── style.css # Styling for the interface
├── script.js # Logic for generating UPI payment links
└── .git/ # Git version control data
```
---

### Features
✅ Simple and interactive UI for UPI payment simulation  
✅ Automatically generates unique transaction references  
✅ Live form validation and feedback messages  
✅ Responsive and clean card-based layout  
✅ Built with pure HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS (no frameworks)

---

###  How It Works
1. User enters:
   - Payee UPI ID (e.g., `merchant@bank`)  
   - Payee Name  
   - Transaction Note  
   - Amount (default ₹1.00)
2. On clicking **“Pay via UPI”**, the app dynamically creates a UPI deep link in this format:
   ```bash
   upi://pay?pa=<VPA>&pn=<PayeeName>&am=<Amount>&tn=<Note>&tr=<RandomRef>
   ```

3. The app then displays a status message confirming that the payment link is ready.

> 💡 Note: This app does **not actually process payments** — it’s a frontend demonstration meant for UI/UX and logic practice.

### Run the Project
1. **Clone this repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/assigment-a.git

```
2.Navigate to the folder
```
cd assigment-a
```

3.Open the app in your browser
```
start index.html     # on Windows
open index.html      # on macOS
xdg-open index.html  # on Linux
```
Technologies Used
 - HTML5 — structure and layout
